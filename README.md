# Recipe_Dialog_Bot

Plain Python recipe chatbot written by Jipeng Sun, Joshua Levitas and Komal Thakkar. Based on the recipe link user input, the bot can assist people on preparing ingredients, answering questions related with cooking steps. The rasa version is under construction.

After configure your environment based on the requirements.txt. Please run dialog.py. The bot is still not smart enough to generalize with all possible utterances. To make sure you can get a solid answer, try to follow our example stories.

Thanks!
